            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My short-term goal is to master modern software development processes by learning as wide a range of technologies as possible in the field of full stack development by summer. 
                To this end, I aim to gain strong practical skills in fundamental tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, RESTful API development, SQL Server, and NoSQL databases; I also aim to adapt to technologies used in professional workflows such as Git, GitHub, Docker, and basic DevOps processes. 
                Since every new technology I learn is an important gain for me, I consider this period an opportunity for rapid progress and project-focused learning. 
                My priority is to continuously improve myself in the full stack ecosystem until graduation and build a comprehensive portfolio, becoming a technically prepared candidate for internships and job applications. 
                In the long term, I aim to broaden my professional experience and transition into a more comprehensive career path that combines my full-stack knowledge with a data science perspective, specializing in Python, data analysis, machine learning models, and AI-based systems.
